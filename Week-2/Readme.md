# 📚 ADT in Stacks (Static & Dynamic) - C++

This repository contains implementations of Abstract Data Types (ADT) in stacks using both static and dynamic memory allocation in C++.

## 📖 Chapters

1. **🔍 Introduction to Stacks**
   - Definition and real-world applications
   - LIFO principle

2. **📦 Abstract Data Types (ADT)**
   - Concept of ADT
   - ADT in stacks

3. **📌 Static Stack Implementation**
   - Array-based stack
   - Push, Pop, Peek operations
   - Overflow & Underflow conditions

4. **🔗 Dynamic Stack Implementation**
   - Linked list-based stack
   - Memory allocation & deallocation
   - Advantages over static implementation

5. **⚙️ Stack Applications**
   - Expression evaluation (Postfix, Prefix, Infix)
   - Function call stack
   - Undo/Redo operations

6. **⚖️ Comparing Static vs Dynamic Stacks**
   - Performance analysis
   - Memory usage comparison
   - Use-case scenarios
